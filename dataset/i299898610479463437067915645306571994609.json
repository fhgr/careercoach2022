For the past nine years, the GCP has been developing high-potential account managers into global business leaders by building capabilities to meet today's and tomorrow's business challenges. The GCP prepares its participants to maintain a continuous stream of insights about the market, competition, and the customers'\u00a0own business, and how the suppliers'\u00a0products and services could change the economics of the customers'\u00a0business model.</p><p>As participants expand their knowledge, their learnings are put to use immediately to contribute to both their global customers'\u00a0and their firms'\u00a0profitable growth and market competitiveness. The most tangible evidence of this is the students'\u00a0completion of the Value Creation Project (VCP), a concrete business case and individual action plan to generate measurable value for both customer and supplier. The payback of the GCP is typically realized within six to twelve months after the completion of the program.</p><p>Equipped with new frameworks and tools as well as a personal development plan, the participants will be prepared to master the role of the Global Account Manager (GAM) and play a key role in developing collaborative customer relationships for their firm. Upon successful completion of the GCP, participants receive a certificate designating them \u00abCertified Global Account Manager\u00bb (CGM-HSG) from the University of St. Gallen.</p><p>By focusing on leadership issues in the context of global customer business, participants will:</p><ul><li>Establish an awareness that global customers are a firm's most critical asset and the proper focus of managerial attention.</li><li>Learn to uncover customer issues and translate potential problems into mutually beneficial opportunities.</li><li>Develop new perspectives for building the customer-centric firm of the future and reconsider issues such as strategy, governance, and change.</li><li>Enhance their ability to build commitment within their organization by applying new concepts and tools.</li><li>Understanding the global business environment.</li><li>Creating, delivering and measuring value.</li><li>Mastering the global account manager role.</li><li>Leading the transformation to customer-centricity.</li><li>Driving the firm's growth agenda.</li><li>Linking customer management to shareholder value.</li></ul></div></div><div class=\"field field--name-field-programme-benefits field--type-text-long field--label-above\"><h2>Ihr Nutzen</h2><div class=\"body-text\"><ul><li>The \"gold standard\" in global sales education</li><li>Transforming GAMs to true \"Customer General Managers\"</li><li>Focus on rigor, relevance and tangible results</li><li>A curriculum designed for GAMs to accomplish on the job</li><li>Highly interactive and blended learning approach</li><li>Proven track record and support from leading global firms</li><li>Limited class size for maximum benefits</li><li>Unmatched ROI for global sales leader development</li></ul><p>THE INDIVIDUAL</p><p>Although most Global Account Managers have come into the position based on documented past successes, too many are simply not equipped with the business acumen required to engage in such value creation activity that truly embeds the supplier in the customer\u2019s strategy.</p><p>That\u2019s because the sales model that most professionals have been trained on (and many still are) is to sell to customer needs. However, in a world of transparency with well-informed, specialized buyers, selling to customer needs means that the customer knows exactly what he/she wants and can therefore control the buying process. The truth is, being skilled at needs-based selling does not provide an effective arsenal for selling to the wallet of the future, which is shaped by key business and economic decisions that the customer is making today . The GAM Certification Program fills this gap by preparing today\u2019s GAMs to be true \u201ccustomer general managers\u201c who can maintain a continuous stream of insights about the market, the competition, the customer\u2019s own business and how the supplier\u2019s products and services could change the economics of the customer\u2019s business model.</p><p>THE SPONSORING COMPANY</p><p>The GAM Certification Program (GCP) delivers an unmatched return on investment to sponsoring companies. Throughout the year, participants\u2019 firms gain access to the latest research findings and lessons learned from leading companies. As participants expand their knowledge, their learnings are put to use immediately to contribute to both their customers\u2019 and their firm\u2019s profitable growth and market competitiveness. The most tangible evidence of this is the mandatory completion of the Value Creation Project, an independent study exercise that constitutes a concrete business case and individual action plan to generate measurable value for both customer and supplier. Moreover, participating firms remain at the forefront of the race for talent with a developed pool of well-prepared, knowledge-able global account managers.</p></div></div><div class=\"field field--name-field-programme-app-criteria field--type-text-long field--label-above\"><h2>Bewerbungsvoraussetzungen</h2><div class=\"body-text\"><p>Access is restricted to a limited number of participants.

The mix of renowned professors and experienced practitioners offers the diversity of approaches and opinions that keeps seasoned sales professionals interested and engaged. Moreover, the program is highly sensitive to the demanding role of the GAM, boasting a schedule that provides academic rigor while being sufficiently flexible to enable students to keep up with the demands of their \u201cday-job\u201d.</p><p>HIGH IMPACT METHODOLOGIES</p><p>A highlight of the GCP curriculum is the use of the Case Method of teaching. By engaging students in business conflicts developed from real events, cases immerse them in the challenges they are expected to face. The GCP features custom-developed cases, all dealing with a critical aspect of strategic customer management. The challenges presented require thoughtful analyses with limited or even insufficient information, and demand decisive action that must be articulated \u2013and even defended \u2013 among other talented, ambitious individuals.</p><p>INDEPENDENT STUDY</p><p>As participants expand their knowledge, their learnings are put to use immediately to contribute to both their customers\u2019 and their firm\u2019s profitable growth and market competitiveness. The most tangible evidence of this is a student\u2019s completion of the Value Creation Project (VCP), a concrete business case and individual action plan to generate measurable value for both customer and supplier.</p><p><strong>New Skills = New Value</strong><br /><br />\nThe Value Creation Project (VCP) is a unique and critical component of the GAM Certification Program that delivers tangible results. The VCP constitutes in-depth, highly practical project work conducted on an individual basis by each participant under the guidance of the GCP faculty and the student's own management team. As participants expand their knowledge and skills over the five-module program, the VCP serves as their vehicle for putting those learnings to use to contribute to both their customers' and their own company's profitable growth and market competitiveness. The VCP will represent a concrete business case and individual action plan to generate measurable value for both customer and supplier. Successful completion of the VCP is a mandatory requirement for completion of the program and awarding of certification.<br /><br /><strong>Management Participation</strong><br /><br />\nThe VCP provides a meaningful platform for executive engagement and management coaching of GAMs. Ideally, participants will work with both colleagues and supervisors to construct their business case. All participants will have the opportunity to present their VCP to the collective group with their senior management in attendance.</p></div><div class=\"field field--name-field-programme-faculty field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item body-text\"><p>The GAM Certification Program features world-class faculty who represent decades of expertise in their respective fields of study and are recognized for their groundbreaking research.

For the past nine years, the GCP has been developing high-potential account managers into global business leaders by building capabilities to meet today's and tomorrow's business challenges. The GCP prepares its participants to maintain a continuous stream of insights about the market, competition, and the customers' own business, and how the suppliers' products and services could change the economics of the customers' business model.\n\n\n              As participants expand their knowledge, their learnings are put to use immediately to contribute to both their global customers' and their firms' profitable growth and market competitiveness. The most tangible evidence of this is the students' completion of the Value Creation Project (VCP), a concrete business case and individual action plan to generate measurable value for both customer and supplier. The payback of the GCP is typically realized within six to twelve months after the completion of the program.\n\n\n              Equipped with new frameworks and tools as well as a personal development plan, the participants will be prepared to master the role of the Global Account Manager (GAM) and play a key role in developing collaborative customer relationships for their firm. Upon successful completion of the GCP, participants receive a certificate designating them \u00abCertified Global Account Manager\u00bb (CGM-HSG) from the University of St. Gallen.\n\n\n              By focusing on leadership issues in the context of global customer business, participants will:\n\n                * Establish an awareness that global customers are a firm's most critical asset and the proper focus of managerial attention.\n                * Learn to uncover customer issues and translate potential problems into mutually beneficial opportunities.\n                * Develop new perspectives for building the customer-centric firm of the future and reconsider issues such as strategy, governance, and change.\n                * Enhance their ability to build commitment within their organization by applying new concepts and tools.\n                * Understanding the global business environment.\n                * Creating, delivering and measuring value.\n                * Mastering the global account manager role.\n                * Leading the transformation to customer-centricity.\n                * Driving the firm's growth agenda.\n                * Linking customer management to shareholder value.\n\n            Ihr Nutzen\n\n                * The \"gold standard\" in global sales education\n                * Transforming GAMs to true \"Customer General Managers\"\n                * Focus on rigor, relevance and tangible results\n                * A curriculum designed for GAMs to accomplish on the job\n                * Highly interactive and blended learning approach\n                * Proven track record and support from leading global firms\n                * Limited class size for maximum benefits\n                * Unmatched ROI for global sales leader development\n\n              THE INDIVIDUAL\n\n\n              Although most Global Account Managers have come into the position based on documented past successes, too many are simply not equipped with the business acumen required to engage in such value creation activity that truly embeds the supplier in the customer\u2019s strategy.\n\n\n              That\u2019s because the sales model that most professionals have been trained on (and many still are) is to sell to customer needs. However, in a world of transparency with well-informed, specialized buyers, selling to customer needs means that the customer knows exactly what he/she wants and can therefore control the buying process. The truth is, being skilled at needs-based selling does not provide an effective arsenal for selling to the wallet of the future, which is shaped by key business and economic decisions that the customer is making today . The GAM Certification Program fills this gap by preparing today\u2019s GAMs to be true \u201ccustomer general managers\u201c who can maintain a continuous stream of insights about the market, the competition, the customer\u2019s own business and how the supplier\u2019s products and services could change the economics of the customer\u2019s business model.\n\n\n              THE SPONSORING COMPANY\n\n\n              The GAM Certification Program (GCP) delivers an unmatched return on investment to sponsoring companies. Throughout the year, participants\u2019 firms gain access to the latest research findings and lessons learned from leading companies. As participants expand their knowledge, their learnings are put to use immediately to contribute to both their customers\u2019 and their firm\u2019s profitable growth and market competitiveness. The most tangible evidence of this is the mandatory completion of the Value Creation Project, an independent study exercise that constitutes a concrete business case and individual action plan to generate measurable value for both customer and supplier. Moreover, participating firms remain at the forefront of the race for talent with a developed pool of well-prepared, knowledge-able global account managers.\n\n\n            Bewerbungsvoraussetzungen\n\n\n              Access is restricted to a limited number of participants.

By engaging students in business conflicts developed from real events, cases immerse them in the challenges they are expected to face. The GCP features custom-developed cases, all dealing with a critical aspect of strategic customer management.
